# Vibe Up Study

## Summary

Randomised controlled trials are the gold standard for the study of causal relationships, but they are often expensive to run, require large numbers of participants, and can take months or years to produce results. Integrating AI into the clinical trials landscape offers exciting potential to deliver faster results at lower costs based on smaller participant cohorts.

Vibe Up, which forms part of the three-year, multi-institutional Optimise Project, presents a novel opportunity to explore the utility of AI-driven response adaptive randomisation in a mental health context. This approach involves running a series of consecutive mini-trials; after each trial, the AI uses participant data to update its mathematical model based on its understanding of how well each intervention worked.

The Vibe Up trial is focused on addressing psychological distress among university students. Among this cohort, such distress can potentially lead to poor academic outcomes, discontinued study, and increased risk of suicide. Previous research shows that targeting mindfulness, physical activity and sleep through the use of psychological interventions can be effective in reducing distress; as such, these are the focus areas of the Vibe Up project.
